# Analysis

## Layer 6, Head 2

In this attention head looking for the relationship between a verb and a preposition, the head is paying specific attention to the verb directly before the preposition. In the first example, talked showed high attention to the masked preposition after it, and in the second example fascinated showed high attention to the preposition 'by' directly after it, 'by completly ignoring the [MASK] verb later on.'

Example Sentences:
- He talked [MASK] the upcoming project
- The cat, fascinated by the mysterious noise, [MASK] gracefully.

## Layer 2, Head 7

In this attention head looking for the relationship between a verb and a direct object. This head is paying attention to the object associated with the verb, even if its further down in the sentence. In the first example, there was high attention to the relationship between chased and [MASK], but these were relatively close. So the second sentence I tried to make it a little harder and push the direct object down further. Even when the direct object is further from the verb, there is still high attention to this relationship specifically.

Example Sentences:
- The cat chased the [MASK].
- The detective carefully examined the mysterious [MASK] found at the crime scene.
